        <h2>About my Poop Scooper</h2>
        <p>
            Qi Yawen is a human from the Philosophy Department of Shanghai University. Although she thinks about the big problems of humanity every day, her greatest mission is to serve me, this cat.
            She claims to study logic and political philosophy, but in my opinion, what she's best at is pouring cat food and scooping poop for me.
            However, she occasionally uses philosophy books as a pillow for me to sleep on, which shows some awareness.

        <h2>Poop Scooper's Skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Can open canned cat food (this is basic)</li>
            <li>Can accurately find my toy mouse hidden under the sofa</li>
            <li>Can write strange papers on the computer (but I think what she writes is not as interesting as the cat scratch board I draw)</li>
            <li>Can tell me bedtime stories (although they are all about Hegel, Kant, but they are quite hypnotic for me)</li>
        </ul>
